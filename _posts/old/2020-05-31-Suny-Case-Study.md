Guessing the current UV radiation by looking at the sky is not easy task, specially in an always-overcast city as Lima, Peru. I'm one of those people that usually wear sunscreen when it's outside, whenever the season.

Weather apps at that time didn't actually pay much attention to UV index, So I decided to tackle the problem myself.

# The Problem

We all know UV radiation is harmful to human skin. In fact, skin cancer is the [common cancer in the US](https://www.aad.org/media/stats-skin-cancer), and UV exposure is one of its leading causes.

But most people don't know what UV index (uvi) is nor know how to make sense of its values, which typically go from 0 to 10.

</p>

Most weather apps either don't grant UV index enough screen real estate or don't provide it at all. So users are left to guessing wether sun exposure is healthy or not by checking at the temperature or by looking how sunny it is outside (neither of those are conclusive factors to determine solar radiation).

UV index deserved better, and my goal was to provide an app exclusively invested to it.

# Audience

A typical user is someone who's comfortable with getting information from a smartphone, likes to spend quality time outside, and it's relatively health aware.

# My Role

As a personal project, I worked as the sole UX/UI Designer and Software Engineer.

# Scope

- Showing current UV index of your city
- Showing same day forecast

# Constraints

- Requires internet connection
- Quickly glanceable, since it's meant to be used right before heading outside or on a quick break from an outdoor activity.

# My process

### Helping makes sense of UV Index scale

I began experimenting with different ways to show the uvi value and its place on the scale as a start.

My goals was to use as fewer elements as possible but without hiding information.

I sensed my early concepts were lacking a cognitive connection  with the idea of solar radiation. And I also wanted the value's severity to influence the UI and to visibly impact it. 

I went back to basics and asked myself: what if I use a single shape reigning over the UI?

Proposal: Using a circle and its radius as a representation of the sun's "intensity".

Bigger the sun, bigger the risk. And the color ranging from cool to warm.

## OUTCOMES AND LESSONS

The app was quite popular on South America and certain regions of Africa. User mentioned me the importance of having the information up-to-date always with them, and how helpful the forecast was to plan their days. 

Where it failed though, was in encouraging users to take appropriate action to protect their skin. People weren't sure what to do (or not do) if a given value were labeled as "Very High" or "Extreme". Should they put more sunscreen or not go out at all? I find Wolfram Alpha to succeed in that regard.

I really liked working on the app and being part of the daily routine of people. Doing something beneficial to people's health is always satisfying.
