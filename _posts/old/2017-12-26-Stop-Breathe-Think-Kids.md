# Can we teach our kids to meditate?

After having established itself in the mindfulness space, 'Stop, Breathe & Think' had an interesting question: Can we make our kids care about meditating?

Aimed at kids between 6 and 11 years old, the project provided us with a unique oportunity to explore outside our comfort zones and reach to this audience for the first time.

As the lead developer, I collaborated closely with the UX team for iterating the product and providing a meaningful experience for children like our own.
