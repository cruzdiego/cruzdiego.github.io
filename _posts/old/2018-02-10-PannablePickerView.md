A custom UIKit picker component inspired by [Rise](http://rise.simplebots.co) and [Timely](https://timelyapp.com) apps. Select your value by dragging up and down. Highly customizable.

Currently updated with Swift 4.0 for iOS 9 and later projects.

# Flexible and customizable

One of my main goals was keeping the component as self contained as possible, without letting the developer lose control over their work. Thanks to IBDesignable and IBInspectable, it's tighly integrated with Storyboard, so you can easily use it as any other native UIKit component.

# Features

- Importable with CocoaPods
- IBDesignable and IBInspectable. Customize it right on Storyboard!
