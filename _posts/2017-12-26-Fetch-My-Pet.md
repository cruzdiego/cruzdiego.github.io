Always keep track of your pet with Fetch My Pet, thanks to its companion bluetooth collar and its geofencing technology.

Developed with Swift for iOS 9 and later iPhone devices.

# Taking care of pets, together

GPS collars are expensive and require their battery drains really quickly. By using Bluetooth beacon technology and geofencing, the app can create a whole network of devices in search of missing pets. 

# Features

- Track when your pet leaves your sight
- Report a pet as missing, sending an "AMBER" alert like to all the nearby users
- Track automatically if another user has encountered your pet
